## üî• 6 Landmarks, 6 Colors for a Beautiful UI

I personally went out in London and went to several famous landmarks to find the perfect colors for this palette. These landmarks from the great city of London come with photos on the site as well, so that you can get to know London better than ever. These long-lasting and beautiful landmarks and sites will make for long-lasting and beautiful UI for your site.

Each color on the London Color Palette comes with 10 distinct tints and shades, for text, backgrounds, and anything else you might need for your UI.

## üéÅ Multiple Color Formats, Color Psychology Built-in, and Get to Know London Better Than Ever!

Each color can be easily copied in any format you would like, whether that be Hex, RGB, or even RGBA. Your format choice is saved on your machine as well, so you don't have to change it every time you go back to the palette and grab another color.

Each color is based on a London landmark, and the information icon (on the top left of the color box) gives you the option to read a quick blurb about the landmark and where it is. With this, you can understand a backstory behind your color of choice, which can be fun to share with users as well.

The information icon section also gives you some quick color psychology information, which gives you the ability to understand how prospective users of your site will subconsciously feel as their scroll through your London-color-based UI.

## ü§ù Open Sourced and Free to Use!

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome!<br />Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/xtrp//issues).

London Color Palette is written in:

 - Basic HTML and client-side JavaScript (with a couple extra libraries for various features)
 - SASS for the styling, split into the 7&ndash;1 folder structure convention.

To contribute:

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xtrp/.git
```

2. Go to the project directory and install dependencies:

```sh
cd  && npm install
```

3. Run "npm run compile:sass" to compile your SASS in realtime. For the SASS to be compiled with this command, you'll need to save the ```main.scss``` file in the ```sass``` folder.

4. Open ```index.html```, and you're set up!
